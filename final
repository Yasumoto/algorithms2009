"We've learned about this, now how would you extend it to deal with.."
Don't forget to exploit partial credit "I see some structure here, and some here. Maybe we can exploit this to do..."

Algorithm Techniques
------------------------
Dynamic Programming
Heuristic Algorithms
	- What is a heuristic
	- admissable/consistent
	- when & why
Probabilistic/Random/Optimization Algorithms
	-EM w/Mixtures of Gaussians (Expectation Maximization)
	- compare to kmeans
	- data structures
		- skip lists (be able to talk about comparison with other structures)
Complexity
--------------
P vs. NP
<= p (polynomial time reducible) (doing reductions) (there's a reduction problem on the exam) (make sure you know about 3 sat, since satisfiability is used a lot)
NP completeness
Tractible vs. Intractible (If it's tractible, it can be solved computationally)
	- Halting problem
