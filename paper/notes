write title and abstract for paper.

in this paper we present blah blah, which does this.

we'll also look at the history of its development and provide its analysis... blah blah applications of it.

make sure when you go back and read your abstract, it makes you want to read it.

write in the first person (we) or be consistent with tenses

intro should really motivate the paper. it isn't an extended abstract, it's "here's why this matters."
"there are many areas that matter, here's why this is so important"
also say what contributions you're making

1st introductory paragraph, 2nd more technical, 3rd detail your work, then you discuss "in section 2 we'll... in 3 we'll...."
this helps transition between the last para of the intro to the body of the paper
paragraphs should be correctly sized, 1.5 pages too long, 2 sentences too short
intro - 4 paragraphs to be safe. the intro should be first page on two-column paper.

don't use colloquialism
