\author{Joe Smith}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we will present the Maximum Flow problem, as well as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to solve it. The Maximum Flow problem is given a directed graph, one must find the path of greatest length from a source to a sink. We shall also discuss the history of its development, as well as discuss an application of the problem.
